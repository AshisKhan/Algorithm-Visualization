The files which are uploaded for a star path finidng algorithm are named as  "a star path finding.py" and "spot_class.py".
This above algorithm is used to find the shortest distance between two points even in the presence of complex barrier between those two points.

The file uploaded for the insertion sorting algorithm is named as  "insertion_sorting.py". This algorithm is used to sort the inputs from smaller to bigger value.
